This could lead to potential vulnerabilities (https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11290).\r\nSolution: jQuery version 1.9.0b1 has been released to address the issue. Please refer to vendor documentation (https://blog.jquery.com/) for the latest security updates.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nCVE-2015-9251: jQuery versions on or above 1.4.0 and below 1.12.0 (version 1.12.3 and above but below 3.0.0-beta1 as well) are vulnerable to XSS via 3rd party text/javascript responses(3rd party CORS request may execute). (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2432).\r\nSolution: jQuery version 1.12.0 has been released to address the issue (http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/08/jquery-2-2-and-1-12-released/). NOTE: Fix was reverted back in 1.12.2, so version 1.12.3 and above but below 3.0.0-beta1 are vulnerable as well. Please refer to vendor documentation (https://blog.jquery.com/) for the latest security updates.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn jQuery versions on or above 1.8.0 and below 1.12.0 $.parseHTML has (lots of) XSS. In these versions parseHTML() executes scripts in event handlers.

An unsanitized source object containing an enumerable __proto__ property could extend the native Object.prototype.

This regex which is used to ensure that all tags are XHTML-compliant could introduce a vulnerability to Cross-site Scripting(XSS) attack. Please refer to vendor documentation (https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/ and https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/) for the security fix details.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.

WAS checks for the missing CSP on all static and dynamic pages. It checks for CSP in the response headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Security-Policy or X-Webkit-CSP) and in response body (http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" meta tag).<P>

HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security it's important to set appropriate CSP policies on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.
","Content-Security Policy is a defense mechanism that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks in modern browsers. The CSP specification provides a set of content restrictions for web resources and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a server to a client where the policy is enforced. When a Content Security Policy is specified, a number of default behaviors in user agents are changed; specifically inline content and JavaScript eval constructs are not interpreted without additional directives. In short, CSP allows you to create a whitelist of sources of the trusted content. The CSP policy instructs the browser to only render resources from those whitelisted sources. Even though an attacker can find a security vulnerability in the application through which to inject script, the script won't match the whitelisted sources defined in the CSP policy, and therefore will not be executed.<P>

The absence of Content Security Policy in the response will allow the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities as the protection provided by the browser is not at all leveraged by the Web application. If secure CSP configuration is not implemented, browsers will not be able to block content-injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting and Clickjacking.

","Appropriate CSP policies help prevent content-injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It's recommended to add secure CSP policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach for securing web applications.<P>

TLS servers can then provide cryptographic evidence to TLS clients that the server certificate has been registered in public logs, thus providing some degree of confidence that the certificate is legitimate.

","The X-XSS-Protection response header provides a layer of protection against reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by instructing browsers to abort rendering a page in which a reflected XSS attack has been detected. This is a best-effort second line of defense measure which helps prevent an attacker from using evasion techniques to avoid the neutralization mechanisms that the filters use by default. When configured appropriately, browser-level XSS filters can provide additional layers of defense against web application attacks.
<P>
Note that HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security the X-XSS-Protection header should be set on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.","It is recommend to set X-XSS-Protection header with value set to '1; mode=block' on all the relevant responses to activate browser's XSS filter.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> The X-XSS-Protection header is not supported by all browsers. Google Chrome and Safari are some of the browsers which support it, Firefox on the other hand does not support the header. X-XSS-Protection header does not guarantee a complete protection against XSS. For better protection against XSS attacks, the web application should use secure coding principles. Also, consider leveraging the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header, which is supported by all browsers.

<P>Using X-XSS-Protection could have unintended side effects, please understand the implications carefully before using it.

The HSTS header instructs browsers that all subsequent connections to the website, for a configurable amount of time, should be performed over a secure (HTTPS) connection only. Additionally, it instructs browsers that users should not be permitted to bypass SSL/TLS certificate errors, in the event of an expired or otherwise untrusted certificate for example. ","If HSTS header is not set, users are potentially vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, SSL stripping, and passive eavesdropper attacks.","For information about how to implement the HSTS header properly, refer to the <A HREF=""https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html"" TARGET=""_blank"">OWASP HTTP Strict Transport Security Cheat Sheet</A>.","","none","none","Strict Transport Security header missing for

The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data. TLS protocol was extended to cryptographically tierenegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over. This is referred to as TLS secure renegotiation extension. This detection determines whether the TLS secure renegotiation extension is supported by the server or not.","N/A","N/A","","none","none","none","
