A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
<P>
1) <B>TCP/IP Fingerprint</B>: The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
<P>
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
<P>
2) <B>NetBIOS</B>: Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
<P>
3) <B>PHP Info</B>: PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
<P>
4) <B>SNMP</B>: The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach.

The attack holds server connections open by sending properly crafted HTTP POST headers that contain a Content-Length header with a large value to inform the web server how much of data to expect. After the HTTP POST headers are fully sent, the HTTP POST message body is sent at slow speeds to prolong the completion of the connection and lock up server resources.

It checks for CSP in the response headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Security-Policy or X-Webkit-CSP) and in response body (http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" meta tag).<P>

HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security it's important to set appropriate CSP policies on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.
","Content-Security Policy is a defense mechanism that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks in modern browsers. The CSP specification provides a set of content restrictions for web resources and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a server to a client where the policy is enforced. When a Content Security Policy is specified, a number of default behaviors in user agents are changed; specifically inline content and JavaScript eval constructs are not interpreted without additional directives. In short, CSP allows you to create a whitelist of sources of the trusted content. The CSP policy instructs the browser to only render resources from those whitelisted sources. Even though an attacker can find a security vulnerability in the application through which to inject script, the script won't match the whitelisted sources defined in the CSP policy, and therefore will not be executed.<P>

The absence of Content Security Policy in the response will allow the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities as the protection provided by the browser is not at all leveraged by the Web application. If secure CSP configuration is not implemented, browsers will not be able to block content-injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting and Clickjacking.

","Appropriate CSP policies help prevent content-injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It's recommended to add secure CSP policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach for securing web applications.<P>
